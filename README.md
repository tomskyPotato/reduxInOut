If you are learning or want to start learning REDUX, please take a look at this tutorial files.
The problem with learning Redux is, that you cannot easily make a "Hello World" application like you use to in other Frameworks/Languages etc.

In this easy Redux example i tried to name the stuff in a way you are able to understand. 
Every tutorial i visited was very cryptical and hard to follow.

For example: I named the Reducers => Reducer1, Reducer2 etc. so that you can find it in the rest of the code.

I recommend the usage of the ReduxDevTool(Chrome/Firefox) https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/remotedev
